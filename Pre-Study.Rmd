# 2011-01-01 to 2014-01-01
## Predictors



#### Already available: 
* DEM 8 / 30m
        * TWI
        * slope
* rock outcrop to use as a mask 
  * use soil type map to find out where there is only rock and no soil
* soil types
* pH model (Pierre: "pH is very much correlated to soil moisture, and more linear 
than EC (because it's already a log scale!), but I could also share EC estimates if need be.") 

      
      
#### To acquire
* RS data: 
    * SWIR 
        * Landsat 8 launched Feb 2013, 
        * Landsat 7 bands 5 and 7 similar to SWIR in L8, since 1999, sensor noise issue, 
        * Landsat 4-5 bands as in 7 since 1984-2013
    * downscaled LST from 1999 on
    * radar Sentinel 1 launched April 3, 2014 - then we only have data for the 7 climate stations
* EC (Pierre)?
