# Work plan

0. write up some stuff I need to know about MDV surface moisture and its behaviour in this RMD as input to the paper 


1. **explore soil moisture dataset**
      * data cleaning necessary? 
      * understand surface moisture and temperature information distributions, determine cut-off value (0°C? -x°C?) 
      * spatial configuration of loggers, i.e. think about validation strategy (how to do the spatial CV)
2. data gathering for **pre-study**: find a cloud free day and get as many useful spatial predictor datasets as possible 
3. **describe and understand relations between surface moisture and predictors** & temperature
      * surface moisture and elevation
      * surface moisture and temperature 
4. build **model for case study**
4. **run workflow for the whole temporal and spatial setting** 

# To do's: 
* ask Pierre about salinity and pH-paper progress

# Paper relevant info

## Introduction

### Research Question:

* For Method 1 and 2:  <font size="4"> <span style="color:YellowGreen">**How accuarate can surface moisture be modeled for the open soil areas within the Antarctic Dry Valleys? **</span> </font> 

* actually interesting question:  <font size="4"> <span style="color:YellowGreen">**Which factors does the spatio-temporal surface moisture configuration in the MDV depend upon?**</span> </font>  

### What we know about surface moisture in the MDV
Take a look at [Overleaf note collection](https://www.overleaf.com/project/619e2470546c2f71f23a9ae2)

## Questions

* should I only use values above 0 degrees? Find out when water freezes in the 
MDV and how the relation to salinity would be

* How does RH relate to soil moisture?

* can we detect Soil Moisture directly with RS techniques? or is indirect modelling
needed? 


## Data 

### Calibration and validation 
![AWS and iButton spatial and temporal distribution](calib_valid_data.png){width=600}

#### Already available: 
* iButton data

#### To download: 

### Antarctica Soil Climate Research Stations 
Data can be found [here](https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/detail/soils/home/?cid=nrcs142p2_053772). 


### Get following Variables: 
ID, 
Year, 
Hour, 
Date
Air Temp (°C, 1.6m)
Solar Radiation (W/m²), 3m
Wind Speed (m/s), 3m
Wind Direction (azimuth), 3m

Soil Temp (°C) Surface under white rock
Soil Temp (°C) Surface under black rock

Soil RH (%) 5cm
Soil RH (%) 15cm

MRC Soil Temp °C 0 in 
MRC Soil Temp °C 3 in 7,6cm

Soil 2cm: 
ER	unitless	Real dielectric constant
EI	unitless	Imaginary dielectric constant
Temp	°C	Temperature
ER_COR	unitless	Temperature corrected ER
EI_COR	unitless	Temperature corrected EI
WATER	wfv	Soil moisture
SALINITY	g NaCl/L	Soil salinity
SOIL_COND	S/m	Soil conductivity
SOIL_COND_COR	S/m	Temp corrected soil conductivity
WATER_CON_COR	S/m	Temp corrected conductivity of the water in the soil

* Met station AWS - can't be used, RH measurement at 3m height 
[quality controlled and official data](https://mcm.lternet.edu/meteorology-data-sets) (until 2019 or 2020)
[non quality controlled but full record until now](https://mcm.lternet.edu/meteorology-real-time-data)  

[Example: Explorer's Cove](https://mcm.lternet.edu/content/high-frequency-measurements-explorers-cove-meteorological-station-exem-mcmurdo-dry-valleys)

Could be interesting to get precipitation from there 


### Potential spatial predictors
![Potential spatial predictors](spatial_predictors.png){width=300}

#### Already available: 
* DEM 8 / 30m
        * TWI
        * slope
* rock outcrop to use as a mask 
  * use soil type map to find out where there is only rock and no soil
* LST 30m 
* soil types
* pH model (Pierre: "pH is very much correlated to soil moisture, and more linear 
than EC (because it's already a log scale!), but I could also share EC estimates if need be.") 

      
      
#### To acquire
* RS data: 
    * SWIR 
    * downscaled LST 
    * radar
* EC (Pierre)?

## Methods

* Statistical Exploration of associations 
  * check wind relevance with station data? 
* Modelling
* Explainable AI to find out which factors are relevant how
* Analysis of Moisture patterns
